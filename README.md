The Goal of this repo is to teach you how to design a capacity dropper power supply.

Warning:
Before we start it is important to note that the capacity dropper power supply is extremely dangerous because it doesnot provide isolation of the input to output side. Replicate it on your own risk


Components:

1. Source


2. Capacitor which must be X rated


3. Diodes


4. Electrolytic capacitor


Source:


lets first define our Source side which will be Mains in most of the cases. I am using 220V and 50Hz.


Output side


in this example we will be designing for 5V and 250mV on the ouput when the load is known. 


Voltage Divider
The capacity dropper is essentialy a voltage divider which we are dropping all the voltages on one resistor and getting the required on our load
